# Mybizz Division — Docmap

**Purpose:** the navigation map of the Mybizz division: where every folder lives, what it is for, and where new files go. Agents read this to understand the territory.

**Verified:** 2026-10-23

**Kept current:** `build-docmap.py` rebuilds the folder trees from the real folders (`python3 /mnt/c/mybizz/scripts/build-docmap.py --write`); see [[[mybizz-os-docs:operating-procedures/daily-ops|Daily Ops]]](C:/mybizz/mybizz-os-docs/operating-procedures/daily-ops.md). Repositories, their GitHub names and GBrain sources are listed in [[[mybizz-os-docs:os-reference-docs/repo-organization|Repo Organization]]](C:/mybizz/mybizz-os-docs/os-reference-docs/repo-organization.md); this map does not repeat them.

## 1. Division Root — `C:\mybizz\`

The MyBizz operating system: its documentation, its own skills, its scripts and the third-party clones it uses.

```

```

## 2. Division Management — `C:\data-mybizz-mgt\`

The desktop-level operating documents of the division, and the developer's model and tool working files. Not an Anvil project and not a code repository. Kept apart from `C:\pdlf\`.

```
C:\data-mybizz-mgt\
├── archive/                ← Archived material (never referenced)
├── assets/                 ← Images and logos
├── desktop/                ← Operating documents: developers-duties, master-task-list
├── Models/                 ← Model selection and model inventory
├── temp/                   ← Temporary files
├── Tools and apps/         ← Notes on tools and apps
├── WIP/                    ← Working files
└── README.md               ← What this folder is
```

---

## 3. Development Hub — `C:\dev\`

Where applications are developed. Each business has one project folder, `dev-{slug}`, holding four code repositories and one project library. Folders without the `dev-` prefix support every project.

```
C:\dev\
├── dev-mb-3-cs\                               ← Business mb-3-cs
│   ├── mb-3-cs-app1/                          ← App 1 code repository
│   ├── mb-3-cs-app2/                          ← App 2 code repository (a release of App 1)

│   ├── mb-4-ecom-app1/                        ← App 1 code repository
│   ├── mb-4-ecom-app2/                        ← App 2 code repository (a release of App 1)
│   ├── mb-4-ecom-app3/                        ← App 3 code repository
│   ├── mb-4-ecom-app5/                        ← App 5 code repository

├── dev-root\                                  ← Hub of the development folder
│   ├── docmap.md                              ← This map
│   └── README.md                              ← What this folder is
├── project-library-global\                    ← Universal context library for every Anvil app

│   ├── test-suite/                            ← Test method, catalogue and conformance checks
│   └── README.md                              ← What this library is
└── project-template\                          ← Skeleton copied into a new project at Step 11
```

---

## 4. PDLF — `C:\pdlf\`

The app factory: the Project Development Lifecycle Framework that takes an application from idea to release. A separate repository from `C:\data-mybizz-mgt\`; the two are never merged.

```
C:\pdlf\
├── app-factory/            ← One set of step documents per pipeline step
├── pdlf-library/           ← PDLF's own ADRs, specifications, policies, templates and explainers
├── AGENTS.md               ← Standing rules for this location
└── README.md               ← What PDLF is
```

---

## 5. Other Roots

| Folder | What it is |
|---|---|
| `C:\backup-daily\` | DailyDevBackup copies of the development folders |
| `C:\backup-dream-cycle\` | GBrain exports made by SundayBackup |
| `C:\backup-gbrain\` | PostgreSQL backups made by SundayBackup |
| `C:\backup-general\` | General backups |
| `C:\backup-pre-pdlf-sanity-sweep\` | Full copies of the repositories changed by the PDLF sanity sweep |
| `C:\backup-wsl\` | Backups made by WSL scripts, one folder per script |
| `C:\temp\` | Temporary files outside PDLF |

Backup folders are snapshots: never tracked, never scanned, never referenced as knowledge.

Outside the division and never mapped: `C:\_data-not mybizz\`, `C:\_data-mybizz-exempt\` and `C:\projects-reference\`, which hold personal content.

## 6. File Placement Rules

| File type | Destination |
|---|---|
| Application code | `C:\dev\dev-{slug}\{slug}-app1\` (and `-app2`, `-app3`, `-app5`) |
| Project documents | `C:\dev\dev-{slug}\{slug}-project-library\` |
| Project config, reference and explainer | The project library, written by `/mb-project-docs` |
| Project working files | `C:\dev\dev-{slug}\wip\` |
| Universal standards (ADRs, policies, specifications, SOPs, templates) | `C:\dev\project-library-global\{category}\` |
| PDLF documents | `C:\pdlf\` |
| PDLF working files | `C:\pdlf\pdlf-library\wip\` |
| Component documents | `C:\mybizz\mybizz-config-docs\{component}\` |
| Operating procedures and system-wide reference | `C:\mybizz\mybizz-os-docs\` |
| Developer's operating documents | `C:\data-mybizz-mgt\desktop\` |
| Long-term reference store | `C:\mybizz\archive\` |
| Development trash | `C:\dev\obsolete\` |
| Temporary files outside PDLF | `C:\temp\` |
| Installed skills (OpenCode) | `~/.config/opencode/skills/` (WSL) |
| Backups made by WSL scripts | `C:\backup-wsl\{script}\<timestamp>\` |
| System and tool logs | `C:\mybizz\logs\{tool}\` |

### archive and obsolete

| | archive | obsolete |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Long-term reference store | Trash during a session |
| **Permanence** | Permanent | Purged by the developer when the work is stable |
| **Who decides** | Developer | Developer |
| **Location** | `C:\mybizz\archive\`, `C:\data-mybizz-mgt\archive\` | `C:\dev\obsolete\` |

## 7. Tool Locations

Repositories and third-party clones are in [[[mybizz-os-docs:os-reference-docs/repo-organization|Repo Organization]]](C:/mybizz/mybizz-os-docs/os-reference-docs/repo-organization.md). The locations below are not repositories of the developer's own.

| Tool | Location | Config documents |
|---|---|---|
| GStack runtime (OpenCode) | `~/.config/opencode/skills/gstack/` (WSL); `bin` links back to `C:\mybizz\gstack\` | `C:\mybizz\mybizz-config-docs\gstack\` |

| PostgreSQL for GBrain | WSL, port 5432 | `C:\mybizz\mybizz-config-docs\postgresql\` |
| PostgreSQL for the PDLF ledger | Windows PostgreSQL 15, port 5433 | `C:\pdlf\pdlf-library\specifications-local\spec-postgres-ledger.md` |
